# Firewall Authenticator 

#### This is a clone of the firewall authentication system used in my college. It's designed such that the firewall window refreshes after every 4000 seconds and the user needs to login into it again.

#### Making the layout and styling was surely a piece of cake but the main job was to implement the decrement counter logic and to refresh the page automatically after every intervals of 4000 seconds.
